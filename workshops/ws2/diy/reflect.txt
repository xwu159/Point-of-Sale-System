I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

1. I need to analyze the output first. How to break down the question in small steps. Is there any pattern? Is there any repeat? How can I use the loop? Is there any loop in another loop?
2. I learned how to read the error/warning message, and study how to fix it. For example, I miss the #include<stdio.h> in the first line and generate an error.
3. Always be careful when you write the code. A space matters. A semicolon matters. An extra letter, a small mistake or negligence can be a disaster. It is never overwhelming to be extremely serious about the code.
4. I am stuck on the highlighted part. In the first beginning, I put the “int collum2=0;” at the wrong place, and I found the output result is not correct. After considering it for a while, I found the value of collum2 will change after the loop. After modifying it, I finally got the right answer.

void rectangle(char leftTop, char top, char topRight,
    char right, char rightButtom, char buttom,
    char buttomLeft, char left, char fill,
    int width, int height) {
    int collum1 = 0;
    int collum3 = 0;
    int row = 0;
  //int collum2 = 0; I put this line here at the first beginning//
    printf("%c", leftTop);
    while (collum1 < width - 2) {
        printf("%c", top);
        collum1++;
    }
    printf("%c\n", topRight);

    while (row < height - 2) 
    {
        printf("%c", left);
        int collum2 = 0;
        while (collum2 < width - 2) 
        {
            printf("%c", fill);
            collum2++;
        }
        row++;
        printf("%c\n", right);
    }
    
    printf("%c", buttomLeft);
    while (collum3 < width - 2) {
        printf("%c", buttom);
        collum3++;
    }
    printf("%c\n", rightButtom);
}
