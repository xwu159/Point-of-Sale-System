I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

1. After analyzing the output, I was stuck because it is kind of tricky. I have a clue after Professor Fardad told us about we need to see if the character after integer is \n. But it still takes a long time for me to figure out how to solve the problem. I am very upset and grumpy. 
It takes me almost 2 days to think about the solution, I even dream about it. 
First, I wrote like this, I still donâ€™t understand why the output is not what I expected. Until I correct them, use devide scanf("%d%c", &value, &test) == 2 && test == '\n' to 2 part, then the code works. 
int getInt() {
    int value;
    char test;
    int done = 0;
    while (!done) {
        if (scanf("%d%c", &value, &test) == 2 && test == '\n') {
                done = 1;
            }
        else if(scanf("%d%c", &value, &test) == 2 && test != '\n'){
                printf("Enter only an integer, try again: ");
                flushKey();  }
        else{
            printf("Invalid Integer, try again: ");
            flushKey();
        }
    }
    return value;
}
2. I still didn't fully understand what the flushKey function mean. I need to figure out what is getchar and what is putchar too, even I search on the website. I will search for some videos or ask the professor to figure it out.
