I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

1. Always remember the punctuation like always remember";" at the end of the command line, For scanf, there should be "&" before the arguments. It is critical and will change greatly if you add space or punctuation to the program.
2. There are different solutions for each of the workshops, you need to know which is the fastest for the compiler, clearest for the user, and the most space-saving for the system. Like you can define d as average=(a+b+c)/3 separately or enter the definition or formula directly in the printf function.
3. learn how to read the error message and try to fix it. Like I was trapped by an error" _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS", there are 2 ways that I have learned to fix the problem, first, add #define _CRT_SECURE_NO_WARNINGS at the beginning of the file, the second way add #pragma warning (disable: 4996) to the beginning of the file by the help of the error message.
4. I may understand the code examples from the teacher, but if I program by yourself, that is another story. Even it is just a simple calculation, it needs to break down the question into a lot of small steps. I need to know the logic. For this assignment, at the first beginning, I type printf(“Enter the marks for the following subjects,\nIPC144: \nULI101:  \nEAC150: \nThe average is: ”), I thought I can add scanf content into the printf, that will mix up and cause confusion.
