In this workshop, I learned how to read the error message and get it fixed one by one. The code had a number of problems with syntax, logic, and input validation, including undeclared variables, format specifiers that weren't accurate, input validation that wasn't there.
I always made the mistake to use "if" as a loop, but it failed as the output is not what I expect.When I analyse the output, I found that that is not a good habit. And What made me consufed at first is that how and where to call the getMMInt function.I also learned formatting for this workshop.I learned to use the F10 and F11 to locate the error output step by step.
Also, I learned the value of careful programming techniques, such as testing, input validation, and error checking, is shown by this exercise. When programming, it's crucial to think through potential mistakes and properly test the code to make sure everything is working as it should. 
Overall, this exercise gave me a great chance to practice debugging techniques and think about how important excellent programming habits are. We were able to comprehend the code and underlying logic better by going over the code step-by-step and meticulously fixing problems. Future programming projects will benefit from this procedure, which will also assist lay a foundation.
