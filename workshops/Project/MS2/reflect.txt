I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code 
that my professor provided to complete my project milestones.
-----------------------------------------------------------
For POS.h and PosUI.h
1.I learned the use of safeguard in the headfile, it ensure that the code within ifn and endif block is only included once in the program. 
2.I also learned how to define constants in headfile to make the code more readble and easier to maintain/modify.We don't need to use the literal value, we can just use the constants. It is easier to modify the code by changing the value of a constant compared with variables.
For POSUI.c
1.for this line at the beginning  input = getIntMM(0, 5, "Selection"), I forgot to use the ""for Selection, the output is null. It take me sometime to fix it.
2.We need to analyse the output to get the logic of the program, where we need to use the loop and where to jump out of the loop.
3.When I saw the code in PosApp.c, I saw start...., I didn't see start function at the top which object is to print and mock up the function. I thought start is a system default function...

When I compile the program, the compile result reveal that there is error for main.c and utils.c, according to the error message, I add #include <stdio.h> and replace = with == in utils.c and it go through.
