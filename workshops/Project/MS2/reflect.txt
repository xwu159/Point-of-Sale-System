I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code 
that my professor provided to complete my project milestones.
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. In order to complete Milestone 2, you must first define an item structure with the SKU, name, price, taxed, and quantity characteristics. Next, you must create a global array of item structures and a global integer variable to count the number of records read. In addition, the functions cost(), loadItems(), and listItems() are defined as helpers .

2.Based on the price, the taxed flag, and the TAX specified in POS.h, the cost() function determines the cost of an item after tax. It accepts an item structure's address and returns the cost that was calculated.

3.The three assistance functions are called by the inventory() method, which then multiplies the cost of each item by its quantity and adds the results to determine the total asset value. In a footer, it displays the overall asset value.

Overall, defining the appropriate data structures and functions to control the management of products and their inventories in the POS system constitutes this milestone. It is a crucial step in putting the system's essential features into place.
